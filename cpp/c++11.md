1. type deduce
- auto: protect your keyboard from typing long types
- decltype: get type from variables

2. move & forward
- use rvalue reference to avoid construct/destruct

3. smart pointer
- unique_ptr: little overhead， owned by one
- shared_ptr: based on reference count, shared between
- weak_ptr: to check shared_ptr empty

4. constexpr
- compile-time const: pre calculated

5. variadic template
- recursive way implement of `printf`

6. atomic
- atomic operation
- memory model

7. TLS
- thread local storage

8. nullptr
- different from `0` and `NULL`
- can't be converted to any other type

9. =default & = delete
- controll over member methods of class

10. lambda & functor
- easy to read
- effient with STL
- be careful with passing value/reference
- avoid copying object
